# PHP-CRUD-API

Simple PHP CRUD API for my internship interview at 2checkout Bucharest. 
I do not customize it a lot, because the job I applied for is back-end developer.

Configuration:
	In /includes/config.php and /includes/db.php you have to change the DB name for  products (config.php) and for users (db.php)
	In /core/initialize.php you have to change the path for the project directory  :
		SITE_ROOT is the path for the project directory ( EX: /homne/user/Documents/RESTApi  is DS.'home'.DS.'user'.DS.'Documents'.DS.'RESTApi')
		INC_PATH is the path for includes directory
		CORE_PATH is the path for core directory

	You have to change the define() for SITE_ROOT.
Used databse: MySQL.
I also used PHP 7.2 and Linux Ubuntu.
